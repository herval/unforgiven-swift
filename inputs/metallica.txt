If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead but keep on turning?

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

You live it or lie it (x4)

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle 
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle

Keep searching. Keep on searching 
This search goes on, This search goes on 
Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, This search goes on

Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock (x4)

I've worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This Frantic-tick-tick-tick-talk of hurry

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made

You live it or lie it (x4)

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle 
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle 

Keep searching, Keep on searching 
This search goes on, This search goes on
Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, On and on

Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock (x4)

Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to do what I shouldn't know?
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to do what I shouldn't know?

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle (Birth is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side (Life is pain)
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle (Death is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side (It's all the same)

Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, On and on
Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, On and on

Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock (x4)

Some Kind Of Monster

These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more

These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the God that ain't so pure
This is the God that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people? (x2)

Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
This monster lives

This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people? (x2)

Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
This monster lives

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone

Ominous
I'm in us (x4)

This is the cloud that swallows trust

Invisible Kid

Invisible Kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible Kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

Invisible Kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible Kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside
But I'll show you...

I'm ok, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm ok, just go away
I'm ok, but please don't stray too far

Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm being right here, right now (x2)

Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Oooh, can't you see that he's not here?
He doesn't want the attention you give
Oooh, unplugging from it all

Oooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself

My World

The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
It's my world now
It's my world... 
It's my world.......!

Mama, why's it rainin' in my room?
Cheer up boy! Clouds will move on soon!
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride!

It's my world
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world

Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out!

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devils in angels way

It's my time now
It's my time now
It's my time... 
Yeah, it's my time.......!

Look out motherfuckers here I come!
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world
You can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out!

Not only do I not know the answer..
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)

God it feels...
Like it only rains on me (x4)

Not only do I not know the answer..
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)

Sucka!

Out of my head, get 'em out of my head
Get 'em out!

Shoot Me Again

I won't go away
Right here I'll stay

Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fades

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet (x4)

Shoot me again
Shoot me again
Shoot me!
Shoot me again
Shoot me again
C'mon! (x2)

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots..
All the shots...

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I won't go away
With a bullet in my back! 
Right here I'll stay
With a bullet in my back!

Shoot me...
Take a shot
Shoot me...
Take a shot
Shoot me...
Take a shot
Shoot me...
Take a shot

I'll stand on my own
With a bullet in my back! 
I'm stranded and sold
With a bullet in my back!

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet (x4)

Shoot me again
Shoot me again
C'mon!
Shoot me again
Shoot me again
C'mon! (x2)

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots..
All the shots...

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, let him sleep

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back...

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots..
All the shots...

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you




Sweet Amber

Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

Oooh then she hold my hand
And I lie to get a smile (x2)

Using what I want
To get what you want (x4)

Ooh, sweet amber

How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get? (x2)

Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over, 'till I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away, but I'm back again

Oooh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

Using what I want
To get what you want (x4)

Ooh, sweet amber

How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get? (x2)

She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in (x2)

Ooh, sweet amber...
Ooh, sweet amber

How sweet are you?
Oooh, how sweet does it get? (x2)

It's never as sweet as it seems!





The Unnamed Feeling

Been here before (x6)

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive... 
It comes alive...
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive...
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before (x6)

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart, hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it'll be here soon

It comes alive... 
It comes alive... 
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive... 
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
....Takes me

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
..Takes me away!

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
....Takes me away!

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, Why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away




Purify

Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old Paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost White
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything

I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I ain't dancing with what might have been

Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify
You and I, Purify
C'mon, Purify!

Of Wolf And Man

1, 2, 1 2 3 4..
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of...life

Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean baby!
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of...life 
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
woah!

Got any wolves out there?? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I feel a change
Back to a better day - shape shift
Hair stands on the back of my neck - shape shift
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I have been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Back to the meaning...of wolf and man, oh yeah!!

The Memory Remains

Fortune, fame

But the (crowd: memory remains) Yeah!

Hide and swallow mansions whole
In light of an already
Faded prima donna

Gone insane...

No Leaf Clover

And it feels right this time
On this crash course we're in the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy!

Says it feels right this time
Turn around, Found new high lights
Good day to be alive sir
Good day to be alive he said, yeahhhh!

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way

Don't it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Suck up for that quick reward boy

Hero of the Day

Mama they try and break me
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they go
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying? yeah
Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me

'Scuse me while I tender how I feel (Thanks to Goob548)
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking starts wheels of dismay!

Don't want your hate 
But the fist I make 
For you, oh no fear
No not on me
So please excuse me while I tell them how I feel, ahh!

But now the dreams end (But now the dreams end)
And now the dreams end
They everlast the night
So build a wall 
Behind it crawl (so build a wall)
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?
I can't hear you!

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams end
And now the dreams end (But now the dreams end)
They everlast the night
So build a wall 
Behind it crawl (So build a wall)
And hide until it's light
Can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama try and break me
Mama try and break me
Mama try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try
Hey Mama they try and break me
Mama they try and break me 
Mama they try and break me
Mama they try 
Mama they try, yeahhhh!! Mama!

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on how they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they are right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill men we kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on, I want it!
(crowd: For whom the bell tolls )
Absolutely!

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud, mother fucker!!
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
wooah Time marches on, give it to me!
(crowd: For whom the bell tolls)
You betcha!

Only knowledge will I save
To this game you stay a slave

Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah

(...And the earth becomes my throne)
And the earth becomes my throne

Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone

Off the beaten path I reign

Rover
Wanderer
Nomad
Vagabond

ONE

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much to real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I lived

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit out from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
Please God wake me!

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me, help me!!

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell 
no, NO, NO NO NO NO NO!!! 






ENTER SANDMAN

Let loose man!
Say your prayers little one
And don't forget my son
To include everyone
ITuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
(crowd: Enter night)
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war dreams of lies
Dreams of dragon's fire
And the things that with bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light, come on!
(crowd: Enter night)
Take my hand
We're off to never never land, hooo yeah!!!

Put your hands together!!

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, and in your head

Exit light, come on!

BATTERY

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns to obsession
Cannot kill the battery, damn right!
Cannot kill the family
Battery has found in me

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns to obsession
Cannot kill the battery, hell yeah!
Cannot kill the family
Battery has found in me

Are you alive?? How does it feel to be alive?? SHOW ME!

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns to obsession
Cannot kill the battery, fuckin a-right!
Cannot kill the family

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE


Do unto others as they have done unto you 
But what in the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness 
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest 


chorus: 

Fight fire with fire 
Ending is near 
Fight fire with fire 
Bursting with fear 
We shall die 


Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast 
Armageddon is here, like said in the past 
chorus: 
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death 
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath 


chorus: 

 



FADE TO BLACK


Life it seems, will fade away 
Drifting further every day 
Getting lost within myself 
Nothing matters no one else 
I have lost the will to live 
Simply nothing more to give 
There is nothing more for me 
Need the end to set me free 


Things are not what they used to be 
Missing one inside of me 
Deathly lost, this can't be real 
Cannot stand this hell I feel 
Emptiness is filing me 
To the point of agony 
Growing darkness taking dawn 
I was me, but now He's gone 
No one but me can save myself, but it to late 
Now I can't think, think why I should even try 
Yesterday seems as though it never existed 
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye 

 



TRAPPED UNDER ICE


I don't know how to live trough this hell 
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell 
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core 
Break the ice, I can't take anymore 


Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 


Crystallized, as I lay here and rest 
Eyes of glass stare directly at death 
From deep sleep I have broken away 
No one knows, no one hears what I say 


Freezing 
Can't move at all
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 


Scream from my soul 
Fate, mystified 
Hell, forever more 
No release from my cryonic state 
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free 
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me 


Freezing 
Can't move at all
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 

 



ESCAPE


Fell no pain, but my life ain't easy 
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger 
I'll fight until the end 
To escape from the true false world 
Undamaged destiny 
Can't get caught in the endless circle 
Ring of stupidity 


Out of my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 


Rape my mind and destroy my feelings 
Don't tell my what to do 
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side 
And I can see through you 
Feed my brain with your so called standards 
Who says that I ain't right 
Break away from your common fashion 
See through your blurry sight 


Out of my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 


See they try to bring the hammer down 
No damn chains can hold me to the ground 
Life is for my own to live my own way 

 



CREEPING DEATH

Slaves 
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh 
Heed 
To his every word, live in fear 
Faith 
Of the unknown one, the deliverer 
Wait 
Something must be done, four hundred years 


So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 


Now 
Let my people go, land of goshen 
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire 
Blood 
Running red and strong, down the nile
Plague 
Darkness three days long, hail to fire 


So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 


Die by my hand 
I creep across the land
Killing first born man 
Die by my hand 
I creep across the land
Killing first born man 


I
Rule the midnight air the destroyer 
Born 
I shall soon be there, deadly mass 
I 
Creep the steps and flood final darkness 
Blood 
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass 


So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 

 



RIDE THE LIGHTNING


Guilty as charged 
But damn it, it ain't right 
There is someone else controlling me 
Death in the air 
Strapped in the electric chair 
This can't be happening to me 
Who made you God to say 
"I'll take your life from you!" 


chorus: 

Flash before my eyes 
Now it's time to die 
Burning in my brain 
I can feel the flames 


Wait for the sign 
To flick the switch of death 
It's the beginning of the end 
Sweat, chilling cold 
As I watch death unfold 
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear 
What I am doing here? 


chorus: 

Someone help me 
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away 
I don't want to die 
Time moving slowly 
The minutes seem like hours 
The final curtain call I see 
How true is this? 
Just get it over with 
If this is true, just let it be 
Wakened by the horrid cream 
Freed from the frightening dream 


chorus: 

 



FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS


Make his fight on the hill in the early day 
Constant chill deep inside 
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey 
On the fight, for they are right, yes, by who's to say? 
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know 
Suffered wounds test there their pride 
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know 


For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls


Take a look to the sky just before you die 
It is the last time you will 
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky 
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry 
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery 
He hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be 
Now the will see what will be, blinded eyes to see 


For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls

The Memory Remains

Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd
Cry the nowhere cheers of honor

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
In light of an already
Faded prima donna

Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets
Behind your back

And can't the band play on
Just listen
they play my song
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Dance little tin goddess

Drift away
Fade away
Little tin goddess

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune
fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

The Unforgiven II

Lay beside me
tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear
to make my demons run
The door is locked now
but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me
than I can understand the you

Lay beside me
under wicked sky
The black of day
dark of night
we share this paralyze
The door cracks open
but there's no sun shining through
Black hearts scarring darkness still
but there's no sun shining through
No
there's no sun shining through
No
there's no sun shining

What I've felt
what I've known
Turn the pages
turn the stone
Behind the door
should I open it for you

Yeah
What I've felt
what I've known
Sick and tired
I stand alone
Could you be there
'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too ?

Come lay beside me
this won't hurt
I swear
She loves me not
she loves me still
but she'll never love again
She lay beside me
but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker steel
yes
she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes
she'll be there when I'm gone Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt
what I've known
Turn the pages
turn the stone
Behind the door
should I open it for you

Yeah
What I've felt
what I've known
Sick and tired
I stand alone
Could you be there
'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too ?

Lay beside me
tell me what I've done
The door is closed
so are your eyes
But now I see the sun
now I see the sun
Yes
now I see it

What I've felt
what I've known
Turn the pages
turn the stone
Behind the door
should I open it for you

Yeah
What I've felt
what I've known
So sick and tired
I stand alone
Could you be there
'cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

Oh
what I've felt
what I've known
Turn the pages
turn the stone
Behind the door
should I open it for you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Oh
what I've felt
Oh
what I've known

I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'cause you're unforgiven too
Oh




Better Than You

I look at you
then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be

Better than you
(Better than you)
Better than you
(Better than you)

Lock horns
I push
and I strive
Somehow I feel more alive
Bury the name for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

Better than you
(Better than you)
Better than you
(Better than you)

Where The Wild Things Are

So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world

Steel dreams and give to you
Shop lift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
By one

Will this earth be good to you ?
Keep you clean or stained through

So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Yeah
toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open too
Beating now under sun and moon
But does heaven know you're here ?
And did they give you smiles or tears ?
No
no tears

Will this earth be good to you ?
Keep you clean or stained through

So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Yeah
toy soldiers off to war

You swing your ass all down
Call to arms are drawn out sound
Toy horses start the charge
Robots
chessmen standing guard
We shall never surrender

All children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stained through

So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Yeah
toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war

So close your ?....?

And the poison ivy chokes the tree

I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child

Empty bottles still in hand

Much too young to focus

Much too young to focus
but to old to see

When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey ma

look it's me

Low Man's Lyric

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has right away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
No one's safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
What is dawning to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'cause low man is due
Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for flame
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
No one's safe from the storm
I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
yeah
What is dawning to do
yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

So I cry
to the alley way
Confess all to the rain
But I lie
lie straight to the mirror
One I've broken
to match my face

The trash fire is warm

Nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
yeah
What is done and to do
yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

Solo
the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forget me
o
you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins



Fixxxer

Yeah
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins in, make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble
But tell me
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in the mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Yeah
Mirror, mirror upon the wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in a mother's son
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in the mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Jab it
Blood for face
Sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse
A ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun
Pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again
So tell me
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in the mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin in me
Oh yeah
No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no



Attitude

Suppose I say
I'm never satisfied
Suppose I say
You cut some root
To make the tree survive
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death
Oh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?
Suppose I say
The vultures smiled at me
Suppose I say
I set them down
n' They plan to pick you clean
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone
Gone, yeah, and gone again
Oh, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I eat
Born into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there
Born into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm bored to death
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone
Gone, gone again
Yeah, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I eat
Born into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there
Born into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?



THE MECHANIX


Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
Your a burner yeah a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when i put it in
Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you
Who ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons buldge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end ya know it feels too slow
I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh one more time ya know i'm in love

NO LEAF CLOVER


And it feels right this time
On this crash course we're in the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy....


Says it feels right this time
Turn around, found new high lights
Good day to be alive Sir
Good day to be alive, he said.....


Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel

All the pieces fall to his wish
Suck up for that quick reward boy
Suck up for that quick reward they said.....

FUEL FOR FIRE (Fuel demo)


This is a pre-release demo type thing of Fuel called `Fuel for Fire`, it sounds just like fuel, but the vocal track has been replaced with some older lyrics. This includes completely different verses from the final version. This version is available on some of the Fuel singles

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!
Turn on the dynamo, into the wild I go,
No other place I know, I know.
Turn on I see red,
Warhorse, Warhead,
Throttle up for speed ahead, yeah ahead.


CHORUS:
Ooooh, on I burn,
Fuel these pumping engines,
Burning hard, loose and clean,
And on I burn, turning my direction,
Quench my thirst with gasoline.


Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,
Can't fight the need for speed,
I'm loose, I'm clean, I'm burning lean and mean, and mean.
Ignite the open trail,
Excite, exhale, comin' on, hot from hell, yeah hot from hell.


CHORUS


Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,
Oooh, yeah-heh.

SOLO1
On I burn!
SOLO2

On, and on, and on..

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!

BATTERY (Hetfield Ulrich)


Lashing out the action
returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power
crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Crushing all deceivers
mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker
feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Circle of destruction
hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury
dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery




MASTER OF PUPPETS 
(Hetfield Ulrich Burton Hammett)

End of passion play
crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me
you can't see a thing
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Needlework the way
never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly
ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me
you can't see a thing
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Master
master
where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master
master
you promised only lies
Laughter
laughter
all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter
laughter
laughing at my cries

Hell is worth all that
natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze
drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me
you can't see a thing
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream

THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE (Hetfield Ulrich Hammett)

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father
roaming free

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos
underground
Cult has summoned
twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city
living death

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell





WELCOME HOME (Sanitarium) (Hetfield Ulrich Hammett)

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full
never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors
no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage

Sanitarium
leave me be
Sanitarium
just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied
it makes him well
He's getting better
can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen
damn it
we will win
They see it right
they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium
leave me be
Sanitarium
just leave me alone
Sanitarium
just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill
it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again






DISPOSABLE HEROES (Hetfield Ulrich Hammett)


Bodies fill the fields I see
hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now
no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields
bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy
made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one
only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill
not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say
when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say
you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blindman

Barking of machinegun fire
does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks
get used to it somehow
More a man
more stripes you bare
glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

Soldier boy
made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one
only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill
not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say
when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say
you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blindman

Why
am I dying?
Kill
have no fear
Lie
live off lying
Hell
hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth
nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself
molded day by day
Looking back I realize
nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy
made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one
only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill
not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say
when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say
you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blindman

Back to the front




LEPER MESSIAH (Hetfield Ulrich)

Spineless from the start
sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
you play the lead clown
Please
please
Spreading his disease
living by his story
Knees
knees
Falling to your knees
suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust
time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money
send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah

Marvel at his tricks
need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
rotting your brain
Chain
chain
Join the endless chain
taken by his glamour
Fame
fame
Infection is the game
stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust
time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money
send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah

Witchery
weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap
hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust
time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money
send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat

Lie




DAMAGE INC. (Hetfield Ulrich Burton Hammett)

Instrumental

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees
conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred
our bodies work as one
Bloody
but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

Slamming through
don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it
but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh
you scream and shout
All flee
with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from

Damage Incorporated

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this
it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated





UNTIL IT SLEEP


(Hetfield , Ulrich)

Where do I take this pain of mine
I run, but it stays right my side


So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me, until it sleeps


Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once, and now it stays


So tear me open, but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, until I'm clean


*It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me


Until it sleeps**


So tell me why you've choosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed


I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps


*--** Repeat


I don't want it


So tear me open, but beware
The things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, 'till I'm clean...


I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the fear still shapes me 
So hold me, until it sleeps...


Until it sleeps...

 


MAMA SAID


(Hetfield, Ulrich)

Mama she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it fore it's done
The brigtest flame burns quickest
Is what I heard they say
A son's heart's owned to mot
her But I must find my way


*Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let your heart go
Or let this heart be still


Rebel my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done


* Repeat


**Never I ask you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still


Mama now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, Help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see


* Repeat


Let my heart go
Mama let me heart go
You never let me heart go
So let this heart be still


** Repeat

 


THE HOUSE JACK BUILT


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

*Opens door so i walk inside
Close my eyes
Find my place to hide
And i shake as I take it in
Let the show begin


Open my eyes
Just to have them close again
Well on my way
But on my way where I've been


It swallows me
As it takes me in it's fog
I twist away
As I give this world the nod


*Repeat


Open my eyes
Just to have them close once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again


Is that the moon
Or just the light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there?
Or just another demon that i meet?


**The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built


**Repeat


Open door so I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin


*Repeat x 2


Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there?
I twist away
Away
Away
Away

 

HERO OF THE DAY


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

Mama they try and break me


The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone


They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way


Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do ya feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?


Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me


'Scuze me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real


Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair


Don't want your aid
But the first I've make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel


*But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind the crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies cryin' now?


Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do ya feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?


* Repeat


Mama they try and break me

 

BLEEDING ME


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

*I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to something 
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better


**I'm pushin' my stay
I'm pushin' my stay to something
I'm pushin' my stay to something better


I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted


This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted


It tears me and I bleed


***Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me 
I'm bleeding me I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me


*** Repeat


I am the beast that feeds the beast
I am the blood, I am the release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught under


*** Repeat


* Repeat


** Repeat 

 

CURE


(Hetfield, Ulrich) 

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek, no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again


He thinks the answer is cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man take another bullet
He's been fooled again


*Uncross your arms and take
And throw them to the cure, say...
I do believe
Uncross your arms now
Take 'em to it, say...
I do believe


The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again


* Repeat


Betting on the cure
Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Yeah everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure


I do believe


Betting on the cure
Yeah, it must be better than this
Need to feel secure
Yeah, it's gonna better than this
It must be better than this
Betting on the cure


Yeah, everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure


I do believe 

 

AIN'T MY BITCH


(Hetfield, Ulrich)

Outta my way, outta my day
Outta your mind and into mine
Into no one, into no one 
Into your step but outta time


Head strong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song
Before... you arrived
But now it's timev To kiss your ass good-bye


*Draggin me down, why you around?
So useless
It ain't my fall, it ain't my call!
It ain't my bitch 


Down on the sun, down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell ya been
Damn it all down, damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again


Stand tall, can't fall
Never even bend at all
Before... you arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-bye

WASTING MY HATE


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

*Good day, how do
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you


Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself
Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time ya pleased yourself


* Repeat


Think you're worthy now
Think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two pronged crown


I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind goin' now?


* Repeat


Ain't gonna waste mt hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
(It's) better to give than to receive


Ain't gonna waste my hate
No, no ain't got time to waste my hate on you
Yea, I think I'm gonna keep it all for myself


* Repeat


Hate 

 

RONNIE


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

Story starts, quiet town
Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way


Then streets of red, red I'm afraid
No confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But oh my god, how that all did change
Now they all pray
Blood stains wash away


*He said "lost my way"
This bloody day
Lost my way
I heard him, he said "lost my way"
This bloody day
Lost my way
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today


I always said, somethin' wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smile
Talked alone, miles and miles


Gallow calls, son I say
Keep your smile, and laugh all day
Think once again, in this boring place
For little boys, how the soon change


Now they all pray
Blood stains wash away


* Repeat


Yeah, well all the green things die
When Ronnie go to the place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why
I'm cursed to wear this name"


Now we all know why children called him
Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket
They'd all fall down


*Repeat

 

THE OUTLAW TORN


(Hetfield, Ulrich,) 

And now I wait my whole lifetime
For You
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For You


I ride the dirt, I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside, search inside
For you


To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so i may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime


Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn


So on I wait my whole lifetime
For You
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime


Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

And if close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
remind me of what left this outlaw torn

 

THE THORN WITHIN


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within
And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame


*I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within


Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within
So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow me
One and the same are we


* Repeat


I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty
For us all


So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

KING NOTHING
(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)

Wish I may
Wish i might
Have this wish tonight
Are you satisfied?


Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?


All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased


*And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around


**Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name


Where's your crown?
King nothing***


Hard and cold
Bought and sold
A heart hard as gold
Are you satisfied


Wish I may
Wish I might
You wish your life away
Are you pacified


All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased


*--*** Repeat


I wish I may 
I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight


I want the star
I want it now
I want it all and i don't care how


Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it


Careful what you wish
You just might get it


Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around




HIT THE LIGHTS (Hetfield Ulrich)

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming its right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights






THE FOUR HORSEMEN (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Time
Has taken its toll on you

The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die





MOTORBREATH (Hetfield)

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean

Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine

Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away






JUMP IN THE FIRE (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
To join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire


 



(ANESTHESIA)-PULLING TEETH

Bass instrumental

Whiplash (Hetfield Ulrich)

Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best you're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on the stage the marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
Cause we are Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash








PHANTOM LORD (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the phantom lord

Fall to your knees
And bow to the phantom lord






NO REMORSE (Hetfield Ulrich)

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse






SEEK & DESTROY (Hetfield Ulrich)

METAL MILITIA (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now

Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal militia

Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land

Twisting and turning

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal militia

Metal militia

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world

Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal militia

THE WAIT


(Original: Killing Joke) 
Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.


The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.


After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.


The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.


The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait. 


 



CRASH COURSE IN BRAIN SURGERY


(Original: Budgie) 
Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.


Raven black is on my track,
He shows me how to neutralize the knife.
Show to me in surgery,
The art of fighting words to conquer life,
conquer life yeah.


Now the wicked lance of fear,
Is driving from my heady mountain brain.
Crash course in brain surgery,
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again 
yeah, yeah, yeah. 


 



HELPLESS


(Original: Diamond Head)

I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.


See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.


Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.


I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.


See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.


Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.


I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.


Cannot squeeze the life from me.


I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.


Cannot squeeze the life from me. 


 



THE SMALL HOURS


(Original: Holocaust) 
Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.


And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.


And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.


And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day. 


 



LAST CARESS / GREEN HELL


(Original: Misfits) 
I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.
I got something to say, I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread.


Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.

AM I EVIL?


(Original: Diamond Head) 
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.


Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.


As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.


Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.


On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.


I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.


My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.


Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah. 


 



BREADFAN


(Original: Budgie) 
Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,
Gotta make a mint, gotta make me a million.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.


Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner,
With the man with all the filthy money.
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record,
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.


Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,

Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.

Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be. 


 



THE PRINCE


(Original: Diamond Head) 
Now I see his face, I see his smile.
Such a lonely place, no golden mile.
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart.
His deeds through ages past tell of his part.


See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh.


Angel from below, change my dreams.
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem.
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn.
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns.


See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, o-oh, no-oh.


I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way.
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay.
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry.
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die.


See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no.

STONE COLD CRAZY


(Original: Queen) 
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.


Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.


Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah. 


 



KILLING TIME


(Original: Sweet Savage) 
Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of the heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.


Preparations are made for the journey back,
It's a survival, supplies are packed.
No more nights in this eternal hell,
Destination is simple, we move out.


Killing time - You left from the line
. Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.


And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.


The silence is over, they attack again,
Killing and hatred drive me insane.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.


Killing time - You left from the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.


Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.


And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.


Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time. 


 



TOO LATE, TOO LATE


(Originally recorded by Motorhead)
Huh 

I see that nothin's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are

Well this is it you bitch

But you're a rip-off deal

Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too late

(Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979)
Get on! 

You think you see me
In the glass
You think you hear me
Better listen fast

Gone to seed
Think your reason
Is your guilt and greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

You're a financial wizard
Yeah a top tycoon
You're Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you've never had it
Quite so good

Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
That's right

DAMAGE CASE


(Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979)
Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by his face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I Ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

Got no time for a damage case

No time baby!

Hey babe don't turn away

OVERKILL


(Kilmister, Clarke, Taylor)
(Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979) 
Only way to feel the noise

So good I can't believe it
Screamin' with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill

Shut up

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead

I'll be seeing you... in Hell


Don't cry to me oh baby

TURN THE PAGE


(Bob Seger)

On a long and lonely highway east of omaha
you can listen to the engine, moanin out as one long song
you can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before


and your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
you don't feel much like travelin', you just wish the trip was through


CHORUS:
but here I am, on the road again
here I am, up on the stage
here I go, playing the star again
there I go, turn the page


you walk into a restaraunt, strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
sometimes you can here 'em talk, other times you can't


all the same 'ole cliches: is that a woman or a man?
and you always seem outnumbered, you dare not make a stand


CHORUS:


out there in the spotlight, your a million miles away
every ounce of energy, you try to give away
and the sweat pours from your body, like the music that you play
later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
echos of the amplifiers, ringin' in your head
as you smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what she said 


 



LOVERMAN


There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
There's a devil waiting outside your door
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
There's a devil waiting outside your door

There's a devil crawling along your floor
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There's a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and
he's hungry and he's sore
And he's lame and he's blind
and he's dirty and he's poor
ive him more

ASTRONOMY


Clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand's become a crust
Most of you have gone away

Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door to let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never
Never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Astronomy...a star 


 



SABBRA CADABRA


I feel so good, I feel so fine
I love my little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me, love me every single day!

I feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
It feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, I'll love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universe of secret obtains
Destruction of the empty spaces
Here's my one and only prayer
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child never was concieved
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know it hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the knife you have 
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feel so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah! 


 



THE MORE I SEE


(Originally recorded by Discharge)

From where I stand I see
Pain suffering and misery

The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe

From where I stand I see
Hate violence and war

The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe


 



TUESDAY'S GONE


(Originally recorded by Lynyrd Skynyrd)

Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, I'll try again
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on, many miles from my home
See, I'm riding my blues away
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free
But somehow, I've got to carry on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

MERCIFUL FATE


(All songs originally recorded by Mercyful Fate) 
Satan's Fall 
They're walking by the night 
The moon has frozen blue 
Long black coats a shelter for the rain 
Their load must get through 
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call 
Seven satanic Hell preachers 
Heading for the hall 
Bringing the blood of a newborn child 
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall 

Curse Of The Pharaohs 
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings 
Where the mummified pharaohs 
Pretend dead in their sleep 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly 
Just destroying your future 
Makin' it all shady 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 

A Corpse Without Soul 
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse 
I'm a corpse without soul 
Satan, he's taken, he's taken 
He's taken his toll 
And he took it on me 
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped 
I'm trapped in his spell 
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going 
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell 

Into The Coven 
Howl like a wolf 
And a witch will open the door 
Follow me and meet our high priestess 
Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 
Undress until you're naked 
And put on this white coat 
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring 
Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 

Evil 
I was born on the cemetery 
Under the sign of the moon 
Raised from my grave by the dead 
And I was made a mercenary 
In the legions of Hell 
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane 
You know my only pleasure 
Is to hear you cry 
I'd love to hear you cry 
I'd love to see you die 
And I'll be the first 
To watch your funeral 
And I'll be the last to leave 
I'd love to hear you cry 
And when you're down beyond the ground 
I'll dig up your body again 
And make love to shame 
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye 
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye 
You've gotta say goodbye 
'Cause I will eat your mind 


 



IT'S ELECTRIC


(Originally recorded by Diamond Head)

I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gotta groove from night to day
Gotta blow my crummy job
Gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be wild my friend
I gotta push it through

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red and I leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the tilts from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red and I leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the tilts from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric 


 



FREE SPEECH FOR THE DUMB


(Originally recorded by Discharge)

Free speech, free speech for the dumb

Free speech, free speech for the dumb

BLITZKRIEG


(Original: Blitzkrieg) 

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.


The day is coming, armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.


Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.


The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg. 




ENTER SANDMAN


Say your prayers little one
don't forget
my son
to include everyone
tuck you in
warm within
keep you free from sin
till the sandman he comes
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight
exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land

something's wrong
shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren't of snow white
dreams of war
dreams of liars
dreams of dragon's fire
and of things that will bite
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight

exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land

now I lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if I die before I wake
pray the lord my soul to take
hush little baby
don't say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
it's just the beast under your bed

in your closet
in your head

exit light
enter night
grain of sand
exit light
enter night
take my hand
we're off to never never land

 



SAD BUT TRUE


Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
'm your life
I'm the one who cares
they
they betray
I'm your only true friend now
they
they'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream
make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true
I'm your dream
mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
you know it's sad but true

you
you're my mask
you're my cover
my shelter
you
you're my mask
you're the one who's blamed

do
do my work
do my dirty work
scapegoat
do
do my deeds
for you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream
make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true
I'm your dream
mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
you know it's sad but true

hate
I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
pay
pay the price
pay
for nothing's fair

hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you here
hey
I'm your life
and I no longer care

I'm your dream
make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true
I'm your truth
telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm you
sad but true





HOLIER THAN THOU

No more!
the craps rolls out your mouth again
haven't changed
your brain is still gelatin
little whispers circle around your head
why don't you worry about yourself instead
who are you? where ya been? where ya from?
gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
you lie so much you believe yourself
judge not lest ye be judged yourself

holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
before you judge me take a look at you
can't you find something better to do
point the finger
slow to understand
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
it's not who you are it's who you know
others lives are the basis of your own
burn your bridges build them back with wealth
judge not lest ye be judged yourself

holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not





THE UNFORGIVEN

New blood joins this earth
and quikly he's subdued
through constant pain disgrace
the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in
this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts
the young man struggles on and on he's known
a vow unto his own
that never from this day
his will they'll take away

what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never be
never see
won't see what might have been
what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never free
never me
so I dub thee unforgiven

they dedicate their lives
to running all of his
he tries to please them all
this bitter man he is
throughout his life the same
he's battled constantly
this fight he cannot win
a tired man they see no longer cares
the old man then prepares
to die regretfully
that old man here is me

what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never be
never see
won't see what might have been
what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never free
never me
so I dub the unforgiven

you labeled me
I'll label you
so I dub the unforgiven





WHEREVER I MAY ROAM

...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
so in her I do confide
and she keeps me satisfied
gives me all I need
...and with dust in throat I crave
only knowledge will I save
to the game you stay a slave

rover wanderer
nomad vagabond
call me what you will
but I'll take my time anywhere
free to speak my mind anywhere
and I'll redefine anywhere
anywhere I may roam

where I lay my head is home
...and the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
under wandering stars I've grown
by myself but not alone
I ask no one

...and my ties are severed clean
the less I have the more I gain
off the beaten path I reign
rover wanderer
nomad vagabond
call me what you will

but I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
and I'll never mind anywhere
anywhere I may roam
where I lay my head is home
but i'll take my time anywhere
free to speak my mind
and I'll take my find anywhere
anywhere I may roam
where I lay my head is home
carved upon my stone
my body lie
but still I roam
wherever I may roam





DON'T TREAD ON ME

Liberty or death
what we so proudly hail
once you provoke her
rattling of her tail
never begins it
never
but once engaged...
never surrenders
showing the fangs of rage
don't tread on me

so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
so be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
don't tread on me


love it or live it
she with the deadly bite
quick is the blue tongue
forked as lighting strike
shining with brightness
always on surveillance
the eyes
they never close
emblem of vigilance
don't tread on me

so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
so be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

don't tread on me
so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
liberty or death
what we so proudly hail
once you provoke her
rattling on her tail

so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
so be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
don't tread on me





THROUGH THE NEVER

All that is
was and will be
universe much too big to see
time and space never ending
disturbing thoughts
questions pending
limitations of human understanding
too quick to criticize
obligation to survive
we hunger to be alive

all that is
ever
ever was
will be ever
twisting
turning
through the never

in the dark
see past our eyes
pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
on a quest
meaning
reason
came to be
how it begun
all alone in the family of the sun
curiosity teasing everyone
on our home
third stone from the sun


all that is
ever
ever was
will be ever
twisting
turning
through the never
on through the never

we must go
on through the never
out of the
edge of forever
we must go
on through the never
then ever comes

all that is
ever
ever was
will be ever
who we are
ask forever
twisting
turning
through the never
never





NOTHING ELSE MATTERS

So close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters
never opened myself this way
life is ours
we live it our way
all these words I don't just say
and nothing else matters
trust I seek and I find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters

never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
but I know

so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters

never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
but I know


never opened myself this way
life is ours
we live it our way
all these words I don't just say
trust I seek and I find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters


never cared for what they say
never cared for games they play
never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
and I know

so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
no nothing else matters





OF WOLF AND MAN

Off through the new day's mist I run
off from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
therefore I am
harvest the land
taking of the fallen lamb
off through the new day's mist I run
off from the new day's mist I have come
we shift
pulsing with the earth
company we keep
roaming the land while you sleep

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift back to the meaning of life
bright is the moon high in starlight
chill is the air cold as steel tonight
we shift
call of the wild
fear in your eyes
it's later than you realized

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean

earth's gift back to the meaning of life
I feel I change
back to a better day
hair stands on the back of my neck
in wildness is the preservation of the world
so seek the wolf in thyself

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift
back to the meaning of wolf and man





THE GOD THAT FAILED


Pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
not the word
not the love
not what you thought from above

it feeds
it grows
it clouds all that you will know
deceit
deceive
decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
never your hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
find your peace
find your say
find the smooth road in your way
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave

it feeds
it grows
it clouds all that you will know
deceit
deceive
decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
I see faith in your eyes
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed

pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by deepened nail
follow the god that failed





MY FRIEND OF MISERY


You just stood there screaming
fearing no one was listening to you
they say the empty can rattles the most
the sound of your voice must soothe you
hearing only what you want to hear
and knowing only what you've heard
you you're smothered in tragedy
you're out to save the world

misery
you insist that the weight of the world
should be on your shoulders
misery
there's much more to life than what you see
my friend of misery

you still stood there screaming
no one caring about these words you tell
my friend before your voice is gone
one man's fun is another's hell
these times are sent to try men's souls
but something's wrong with all you see
you you'll take it on all yourself
remember
misery loves company

misery
you insist that the weight of the world
should be on your shoulders
misery
there's much more to life than what you see
my friend of misery
you just stood there creaming
my friend of misery





THE STRUGGLE WITHIN

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
kicking at a dead horse pleases you
no way of showing your gratitude
so many things you don't want to do
what is it? what have you got to lose
what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find?
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within
home is not a home it becomes a hell
turning it into your prison cell
advantages are taken
not handed out
while you struggle inside your hell
reaching out
grabbing for something to u've got to feel
closing in
the pressure upon you is so real

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within

reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within .

ONE (Hetfield,Ulrich) 

I Can't Remember Anything 
Can't Tell If this Is True or Dream 
Deep down Inside I Feel to Scream 
this Terrible Silence Stops Me 
Now That the War Is Through with Me
I'm Waking up I Can Not See 
That There Is Not Much Left of Me
Nothing Is Real but Pain Now 


Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death 
Oh Please God,wake Me 


Back in the Womb its Much Too Real 
in Pumps Life That I must Feel 
but Can't Look Forward to Reveal 
Look to the Time When I'll Live 
Fed Through the Tube That Sticks in Me 
Just like a Wartime Novelty 
Tied to Machines That Make Me Be
Cut this Life off from Me 


Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death 
Oh Please God,wake Me 


Now the World Is Gone I'm Just One 
Oh God,help Me Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death 
Oh Please God Help Me 


Darkness 

Imprisoning Me 
All That I See 
Absolute Horror 
I Cannot Live 
I Cannot Die 
Trapped in Myself
Body My Holding Cell

Has Taken My Sight 
Taken My Speech 
Taken My Hearing 
Taken My Arms 
Taken My Legs 
Taken My Soul 
Left Me with Life in Hell

TO LIVE IS TO DIE (Hetfield,Ulrich,Burton)

I've Outgrown That Fucking Lullaby 
Same Thing I've Always Heard from You 
Do as I Say Not as I Do 


Innocence 
Torn from Me Without Your Shelter 
Barred Reality 
I'm Living Blindly 
I'm in Hell Without You
Cannot Cope Without You Two 
Shocked at the World That I See 
Innocent Victim Please Rescue Me 


Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Hidden in Your World You've Made for Me 
I'm Seething 
I'm Bleeding 
Ripping Wounds in Me That Never Heal 
Undying Spite I Feel for You 
Living out this Hell You Always Knew.




...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL (Hetfield,Ulrich,Hammett)

Halls of Justice Painted Green 
Money Talking 
Power Wolves Beset Your Door 
Hear Them Stalking 
Soon You'll Please Their Appetite 
They Devour 
Hammer of Justice Crushes You 
Overpower 

The Ultimate in Vanity 
Exploiting Their Supremacy
I Can't Believe the Things You Say
I Can't Believe 
I Can't Believe the Price You Pay 
Nothing Can Save You 


Justice Is Lost 
Justice Is Raped 
Justice Is Gone 
Pulling Your Strings 
Justice Is Done 
Seeking No Truth 
Winning Is All 
Find it So Grim 
So True 
So Real 


Apathy Their Stepping Stone 
So Unfeeling 
Hidden Deep Animosity
So Deceiving 
Through Your Eyes Their Light Burns 
Hoping to Find 
Inquisition Sinking You 
With Prying Minds 


The Ultimate in Vanity 
Exploiting Their Supremacy
I Can't Believe the Things You Say
I Can't Believe 
I Can't Believe the Price You Pay 
Nothing Can Save You 


Justice Is Lost 
Justice Is Raped 
Justice Is Gone 
Pulling Your Strings
Justice Is Done 
Seeking No Truth 
Winning Is All 
Find it So Grim 
So True 
So Real 


Lady Justice Has Been Raped 
Truth Assassin 
Rolls of Red Tape Seal Your Lips 
Now You're Done in 
Their Money Tips Her Scales Again 
Make Your Deal 
Just What Is Truth?i Cannot Tell 
Cannot Feel 


The Ultimate in Vanity 
Exploiting Their Supremacy
I Can't Believe the Things You Say 
I Can't Believe 
I Can't Believe the Price We Pay 
Nothing Can Save You 


Justice Is Lost 
Justice Is Raped 
Justice Is Gone 
Pulling Your Strings
Justice Is Done 
Seeking No Truth 
Winning Is All 
Find it So Grim 
So True 
So Real 
Seeking No Truth 
Winning Is All 
Find it So Grim 

So True 
So Real
