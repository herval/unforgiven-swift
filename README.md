Unforgiven Swift
================

# This project moved [here](https://github.com/herval/creative_machines)

A Neural Network that generates random music lyrics crossing the genius writing of Taylor Swift and Metallica.

The Unforgiven Swift also automatically posts its creations on [Tumblr](http://unforgiven-swift.tumblr.com/)

Inspired by the brilliant examples by Andrej Karpathy on ["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

Large portions of the code adapted from Alex Black's [LSTM examples](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/rnn/GravesLSTMCharModellingExample.java)

All code copyleft(c) Herval Freire 2015. The generated lyrics are copyright of Taylor Swift, Metallica, the Unforgiven Swift Neural Network. Or all of them. Or maybe some music consortium. I'm not sure.
